This file is to document ideas on what features could/should be implemented

- uniform storage buffers (constant memory)
- uniform/non-uniform images
- dynamic uniforms
- memory pooling
- async data-transfer/execution
- using multiple queues
- option to use in no-exception builds
- latency hiding, piece-wise execution
- header generation from shaders
